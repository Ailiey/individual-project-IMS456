<p><h5><i>My name is Nur Suhaili bt Nordin and this year, i already turn to 25 years old. I am a Business Administration of Marketing student. Alhamdulillah now i am already in my second years of bachelor degree. Born on 4<sup>th</sup> August 1998 and pure kelantanese. In my family, i am the youngest one from 6 siblings and i have a twin sister, Nur Suhaila. I live with my mom, 2 brothers, sisters and nieces under one roof. My father has passed away 3 years ago. My favourite colour is a soft colours and for hobby, honestly i dont really have a specify hobby but if i have a free time, i usually spent it either by surfing the internet or reading. Specifically, i more prefer a motivation books and ballad songs. As for my character, i am an introvert and extrovert person based on the situation. If i'm with someone who are much older than me or those who i don't feel really comfortable, then i will talk less. But with those who are same age or younger than me,then i will be more talkative. In fact, i also love doing volunteer programs, for the few past year, i joined many NGOs and interacted a lot with people which actually increased my awareness especially towards the state or condition of the people around me. It is also improved my communication skill and leadership. I started being active in this social environment in 2020 until now.</i></h5></p>
